various advantages:

- The integrity and authenticity of this site can be checked by verifying that the commits are signed by my GPG key.
  Commits are also timestamped with [opentimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/).

- It is possible to check it out locally and read it offine, I've aimed to make most posts readable with a text editor.
  You can also build and view the site locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:laanwj/laanwj.github.io.git
cd laanwj.github.io
jekyll serve
```
